##  Featured Projects

| Project | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Secure Inter-VPC Networking & Zero-Trust APIs (VPC Peering + Cognito + API Gateway + WAF)](https://github.com/alevan22/alevan22/tree/main/Projects/Secure-InterVPC-ZeroTrust-APIs) | Designed inter-VPC connectivity (peering, route tables, SG/NACL) and a token-enforced API plane using Cognito JWT authorizer on API Gateway (+ optional WAF). Includes hosted-UI login, token tests, and SSM-only admin access (no inbound SSH). |
| [AWS CloudFormation Drift Detection & Auto-Remediation](https://github.com/alevan22/alevan22/tree/main/Projects/AWS%20CloudFormation%20Drift%20Detection%20%26%20Auto-Remediation) | Scheduled **EventBridge ‚Üí Lambda** workflow that runs `DetectStackDrift`, identifies drifted resources, and restores them to the template state; versioned templates in S3, least-privilege IAM, and audit logs. |
| [GitLab CI/CD ‚Üí EC2 (Dockerized Python App)](https://github.com/alevan22/alevan22/tree/main/Projects/GitLab%20CI-CD%20Pipeline%20Python%20App) | Pipeline with **test ‚Üí build ‚Üí deploy**: dockerizes the app, pushes to Docker Hub, then deploys to Ubuntu EC2 using masked CI variables and branch rules. |
| üÜï **Elastic SIEM + Tines: Automated Alert Triage & Email Summaries** *(WIP link)* | Deployed Elastic Agent on a Windows host in AWS, created detections, and integrated Elastic ‚Üí **Tines** to enrich alerts and send AI-generated incident summaries via email. |
| [High-Availability OPNsense Firewall (CARP + pfSync) + Suricata IDS](https://github.com/alevan22/alevan22/tree/main/Projects/High%20Availability%20Firewall%20Lab%20with%20OPNsense) | Built redundant OPNsense pair with virtual IP failover; tuned 50+ Suricata rules for port scans/malware while maintaining app availability. |
| [Penetration Test: Humbleify Web App](https://github.com/alevan22/alevan22/blob/main/Projects/Humbleify%20Penetration%20Test/README.md) | Identified and documented XSS and access control issues; validated findings with Burp, Nessus, Metasploit; risk-rated and proposed fixes. |
