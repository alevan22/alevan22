## 🧭 About Me

I’m a recent graduate from Virginia Tech with a B.S. in Business Information Technology – Cybersecurity (4.0 GPA, Summa Cum Laude). Currently working at PwC, I focus on IT risk and controls for large financial services firms, while building hands-on experience in cloud security, threat detection, and automation through labs and independent projects.

I'm actively pursuing Security Engineer and Cloud Security roles where I can leverage my technical curiosity, cloud expertise, and drive to build resilient systems.
